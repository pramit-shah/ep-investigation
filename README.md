- **Undocumented Needs**: Requirements that aren't yet clear

### Core Capabilities

**1. Knowledge Gap Discovery**
```python
from ai_orchestrator import AIOrchestrator

orchestrator = AIOrchestrator(investigation_context="...")
analysis = orchestrator.analyze_current_state(incomplete_data)
# Identifies: missing fields, sparse networks, undocumented needs
```

**2. Long Game Strategy Planning**
```python
strategy = orchestrator.create_research_strategy(
    timeframe_days=30,  # 30-day research plan
    max_parallel_tasks=3  # Run 3 tasks simultaneously
)
# Plans: Immediate, short-term, medium-term, long-term phases
```

**3. Full Autonomous Execution**
```python
execution_log = orchestrator.execute_autonomous_research(
    max_iterations=10
)
# AI takes full control: identifies gaps, plans, executes, adapts
```

**4. Multi-AI Coordination**
- 12+ AI systems for different research needs

### Example: Autonomous Investigation

```python
# 1. Start with incomplete data
incomplete_data = {
    'entities': [
        {'id': 'E1', 'name': 'John Doe'},  # Missing: type, connections, timeline
        {'id': 'E2', 'name': 'ABC Corp'}   # Missing: almost everything
    ],
    'connections': []  # Empty - need to discover
}

# 2. AI analyzes and creates plan
orchestrator = AIOrchestrator("Trafficking investigation")
analysis = orchestrator.analyze_current_state(incomplete_data)
strategy = orchestrator.create_research_strategy(timeframe_days=30)

# 3. AI executes autonomous research

## 16. Continuous Task System with Swarm Agents

Break down complex tasks using WH-questions and distribute to swarms of parallel agents for faster completion.

### WH-Question Decomposition

Automatically breaks down tasks into 7 fundamental questions:

```python
from continuous_task_system import WHQuestionDecomposer

decomposer = WHQuestionDecomposer()
subtasks = decomposer.decompose_task(
    "Investigate financial transactions",
    context="Money laundering case"
)

for subtask in subtasks:
    print(f"{subtask.wh_type}: {subtask.description}")
    # WHAT: What transactions occurred?
    # WHO: Who was involved?
    # WHEN: When did they happen?
    # WHERE: Where were they processed?
    # WHY: Why were they made?
    # HOW: How were they executed?
    # WHICH: Which accounts/banks?
```

### Swarm Agent Execution

Distribute work to multiple parallel agents for 2-7x speedup:

```python
from continuous_task_system import SwarmOrchestrator

orchestrator = SwarmOrchestrator(num_agents=7)
results = orchestrator.execute_task_swarm(
    task_description="Analyze 500 documents",
    subtasks=subtasks,
    parallel=True
)

print(f"Speedup: {results['speedup']:.1f}x")  # ~5.5x with 7 agents
```

### Continuous Background Tasks

Schedule tasks to run continuously in background:

```python
from continuous_task_system import ContinuousTaskScheduler

scheduler = ContinuousTaskScheduler()

# Recurring task
scheduler.schedule_task(
    task_id="daily_scrape",
    description="Scrape news sources",
    priority="HIGH",
    interval_hours=24,
    task_type="recurring"
)

# Continuous monitoring
scheduler.schedule_task(
    task_id="monitor",
    description="Monitor file changes",
    priority="CRITICAL",
    task_type="continuous"
)

scheduler.start()
```

### Complete Integration

Use the complete system for continuous investigation:

```python
from continuous_task_system import ContinuousTaskSystem

system = ContinuousTaskSystem(num_agents=7, max_parallel_jobs=5)

log = system.start_continuous_investigation(
    investigation_goal="Uncover all connections",
    focus_areas=["transactions", "entities"],
    max_duration_hours=24
)

# Monitor progress
